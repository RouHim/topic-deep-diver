## MCP Tools

The server exposes three core tools for MCP clients (Claude, OpenCode, Cline):

### `deep_research(topic: str, scope: str = "comprehensive")`
Main research orchestrator that performs autonomous deep research on any topic.

**Parameters:**
- `topic` (required): The research topic or question
- `scope` (optional): Research depth - "quick", "comprehensive", or "academic"

**Returns:** Structured research report with findings, sources, and citations

### `research_status(session_id: str)`
Monitor the progress of ongoing research sessions.

**Parameters:**
- `session_id` (required): Unique identifier for the research session

**Returns:** Real-time progress updates and current research stage

### `export_research(session_id: str, format: str = "markdown")`
Export research findings in various formats.

**Parameters:**
- `session_id` (required): Research session to export
- `format` (optional): Output format - "markdown", "pdf", "json", "html"

**Returns:** Resource link to the exported research report

- Bias detection and perspective analysis
- Information freshness validation

### 4. Knowledge Synthesizer
- Cross-source fact verification
- Narrative structure generation
- Citation tracking and management
- Gap identification and resolution

## Architecture

### Search Integration Strategy

**Primary Search Engines (General Web):**
- SearXNG instances (privacy-focused)
- Brave Search API (privacy-respecting)
- Google/Bing Search APIs (comprehensive coverage)

**Academic Search Engines:**
- Google Scholar API (200M+ scholarly articles)
- PubMed API (30M+ medical citations)
- arXiv API (STEM preprints)
- Crossref API (scholarly metadata)

**Content Extraction Tools:**
- Fetch MCP server integration
- Firecrawl for JavaScript-heavy sites
- Jina Reader for clean text extraction

### Autonomous Decision-Making

**Query Decomposition Algorithm:**
- NLP-based key concept extraction
- Question type identification (factual, analytical, comparative)
- Research taxonomy generation
- Sub-question prioritization by importance

**Source Credibility Scoring:**
- Domain authority assessment
- Publication recency and relevance
- Author expertise verification
- Citation count and impact analysis
- Cross-reference validation

**Completion Criteria:**
- Information saturation detection
- Confidence threshold achievement (≥85% coverage)
- Maximum time/resource limits
- All major perspectives captured
